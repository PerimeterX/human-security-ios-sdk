The SDK delays the error response to your app until the user solve or cancel the challenge. In order to delay the request’s response to your handler until the user interacts with the challenge, you must disable the request’s timeout. Otherwise, your handler will receive a timeout error and you might not know that your request was blocked nor the challenge was solved\/cancelled."}],"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/human\/hsautomaticinterceptortype\/interceptwithdelayedresponse","identifier":"doc:\/\/com.perimeterx.mobile-sdk\/documentation\/HUMAN\/HSAutomaticInterceptorType\/interceptWithDelayedResponse","kind":"symbol","role":"symbol","fragments":[{"text":"case","kind":"keyword"},{"text":" ","kind":"text"},{"text":"interceptWithDelayedResponse","kind":"identifier"}],"navigatorTitle":[{"text":"HSAutomaticInterceptorTypeInterceptWithDelayedResponse","kind":"identifier"}]},"doc://com.perimeterx.mobile-sdk/documentation/HUMAN/HumanSecurity/start(appIds:policy:)":{"kind":"symbol","title":"start(appIds:policy:)","role":"symbol","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Start the SDK."}],"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/human\/humansecurity\/start(appids:policy:)","navigatorTitle":[{"text":"startWithAppIds:policy:error:","kind":"identifier"}],"fragments":[{"kind":"keyword","text":"static"},{"kind":"text","text":" "},{"kind":"keyword","text":"func"},{"kind":"text","text":" "},{"kind":"identifier","text":"start"},{"kind":"text","text":"("},{"kind":"externalParam","text":"appIds"},{"kind":"text","text":": ["},{"kind":"typeIdentifier","text":"String","preciseIdentifier":"s:SS"},{"kind":"text","text":"], "},{"kind":"externalParam","text":"policy"},{"kind":"text","text":": "},{"kind":"typeIdentifier","text":"HSPolicy","preciseIdentifier":"c:@M@HUMAN@objc(cs)HSPolicy"},{"kind":"text","text":") "},{"kind":"keyword","text":"throws"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/com.perimeterx.mobile-sdk\/documentation\/HUMAN\/HumanSecurity\/start(appIds:policy:)"},"doc://com.perimeterx.mobile-sdk/documentation/HUMAN/HSAccountDefender/setAdditionalData(parameters:forAppId:)":{"title":"setAdditionalData(parameters:forAppId:)","kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/com.perimeterx.mobile-sdk\/documentation\/HUMAN\/HSAccountDefender\/setAdditionalData(parameters:forAppId:)","navigatorTitle":[{"kind":"identifier","text":"setAdditionalDataWithParameters:forAppId:error:"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"Set additional data that support Account Defender for given AppID."}],"type":"topic","role":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/human\/hsaccountdefender\/setadditionaldata(parameters:forappid:)","fragments":[{"text":"func","kind":"keyword"},{"text":" ","kind":"text"},{"text":"setAdditionalData","kind":"identifier"},{"text":"(","kind":"text"},{"text":"parameters","kind":"externalParam"},{"text":": [","kind":"text"},{"text":"String","kind":"typeIdentifier","preciseIdentifier":"s:SS"},{"text":" : ","kind":"text"},{"text":"String","kind":"typeIdentifier","preciseIdentifier":"s:SS"},{"text":"], ","kind":"text"},{"text":"forAppId","kind":"externalParam"},{"text":": ","kind":"text"},{"text":"String","kind":"typeIdentifier","preciseIdentifier":"s:SS"},{"text":"?)
